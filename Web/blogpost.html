<h1>A beginner step to efficient country simulation with Python!</h1>
<br>
<p>Simulation is always daunting, and simulating a real-life country? Sounds tough time for the storage servers! But simulation has
always been fascinating, take the famous Sims game for example. It is the multitude of simulation uses, making it a great learning and statistics tool.
<br>
    <br>

I created a Country Simulation as part of data analysis project during my Computer Science Challenges module in Queen's University Belfast. This project took me a brief tenure
of 12 weeks.
<br>
    <br>

The project involves about creating a template in JSON to store the data of a day. Different places in our lives such as bedroom, living room, etc were classified into 'rooms'.
All these rooms had different objects, their states - that is what a person's action could change the object such as if an object is turned on, if it's playing something, etc.
The rooms also had roles which meant a person and their actions. All of this data was stored in a template with different time periods for a day.
This data was then stored into a MongoDB database and fetched through Flask webserver on a webpage, all using Python and a few other languages. The webpage allowed viewing, searching and updating the data.

             <table class="infoBox" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="infoBoxImageCell">
          <img alt="Information" src="Images/info.png" />
        </td>
        <td class="infoBoxText">
          <center><b>Webpage view of the data from the project <a href="Images/Enlarged_animated_webpage.gif">(Click to see full enlarged GIF)</a></b>
          <br>
            <br>
          <img src="Images/Animated_webpage.gif">
          </center>
        </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
        <br>

<br>
So far I have managed to create the simulation of an introvert teenager for a day. I have created an entire guide and project overview for in-depth look at the project.
<br>
<br>
Please view this at:

    </b>
  </p>
<br>

This created an almost simulation of different rooms in a whole day, with changes visible with different time periods. It was made sure as one of the goals of the project
that the data was stored in efficient manner to allow desktop PCs to view and run this project. With minimal and only required information stored in the templates, the project
was capable of running on home desktops.
<br>
<br>
The main aim of this project was to compute a real-life alike country simulation and making sure this data is stored efficiently. While I have just stored the data for a day so far in the project,
I'm certain this can be expanded upon further with changes to achieve this goal.
<br>
<br>
This goal can be further expanded upon by adding months and years to the templates. One has to use a artificial intelligence or a script to make millions of rooms. Data can be plugged in from different sources.
Upon this, we can actually look forward to having a simulation where we can see at what day of what year was a place like. And able to see what changes have been made since then.
<br>
<br>
This can be really helpful for country statistics, knowing how a growth of a country has occurred or for game development purposes. All of this, while being able to run on normal desktops
due to efficient management of resources will be hopefully a breakthrough for data analysts.
<br>
<br>
I hope this can be helpful for someone.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading this,
Lavinia.
